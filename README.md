# Windows Login UI

Simple login UI created with Visual Csharp(Windows Forms Application

Windows Forms (WinForms) is a free and open-source graphical (GUI) class library included as a part of 
Microsoft .NET Framework or Mono Framework,[1] providing a platform to write rich client applications for 
desktop, laptop, and tablet PCs.[2] While it is seen as a replacement for the earlier and more complex 
C++ based Microsoft Foundation Class Library, it does not offer a comparable paradigm and only acts as 
a platform for the user interface tier in a multi-tier solution.
